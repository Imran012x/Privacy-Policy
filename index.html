    <p>Currently, this app does not collect, track, store, or share any personal or sensitive information from its users. We respect your privacy and do not require you to provide any personal details to access the app's content.</p>
    <p>Our application serves as a platform to present publicly available information, notices, e-books, course details, and other academic resources sourced from official BOU websites such as <a href="https://bou.ac.bd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bou.ac.bd</a> and <a href="https://bousst.edu.bd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bousst.edu.bd</a>.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Links and Embedded Content</h2>
    <p>Our app includes links to and embedded views of official BOU websites and related educational resources. When you click on these links or access content via web views, you may be directed to third-party sites not controlled by us.</p>
    <p>We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these external websites. We encourage users to review the privacy policies of any third-party websites they visit.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the app from unauthorized access, data loss, or misuse. However, since we do not collect or store any personal information, the risk of data breach related to personal information is effectively minimized.</p>
